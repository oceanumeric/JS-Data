<h1>Data Visualization In Javascript</h1>


<p>
    THis webiste is a collection of data visualization projects that could be used
    as a reference for future projects. Any one who is interested in data visualization
    in Javascript can use this website as a guide to learn:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>SVG</li>
    <li>D3</li>
    <li>Canvas</li>
    <li>Regl</li>
    <li>Three.js</li>
    <li>WebGL</li>
</ul>

<p>
    The website is built using SvelteKit with minimal CSS as there are so many
    over-designed websites out there. The goal is to make the website as simple
    as possible so that the focus is on the content. No code could be copied
    as I am trying to make the reader to type the code themselves (or with the
    help of AI - Copilot).

    Here is the outline:
